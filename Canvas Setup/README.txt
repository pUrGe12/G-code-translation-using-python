This is the code used to define the canvas and the turtle.

Note: if your turtle graphics windows is not responding, try reinstalling tkinter using
  $pip install tk

Do not use all 'end' commands (like .done(), .bye(), .exitonclick()) together. It will likely cause a crash. Stick to one.
I've chosen mostly default values, no color coding.
